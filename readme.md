+# Implementation of a Perimeter Security System (UTM Firewall)

## Introduction
The increasing number of cyber threats in corporate environments has highlighted the importance of strengthening network infrastructure. This project focuses on the implementation of a Unified Threat Management (UTM) system to protect the organization’s internal network against malware, intrusion attempts, and unauthorized access. The main goal is to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability through a comprehensive perimeter security solution.

## Objectives

### General Objective
To implement a UTM system that provides integrated protection for the organization’s IT infrastructure, ensuring a secure and reliable network environment.

### Specific Objectives
- To evaluate the current state of the organization's network security.
- To install and configure a UTM device with firewall, antivirus, VPN, and intrusion prevention features.
- To establish access control policies and monitoring mechanisms.
- To train IT personnel on the use and maintenance of the new security platform.

## Methodology
The project followed a structured methodology divided into four stages:

1. **Analysis Phase:** Assessment of existing network vulnerabilities and definition of security requirements.
2. **Design Phase:** Planning of network topology and selection of the most appropriate UTM solution.
3. **Implementation Phase:** Installation, configuration, and integration of the UTM device within the institutional network.
4. **Testing and Evaluation Phase:** Verification of system performance and validation of established security policies.

## Development and Implementation
After analyzing different UTM solutions, **Fortinet FortiGate 60F** was selected for its robust protection capabilities and scalability. The device was installed between the organization’s internet gateway and internal network.  

Key configurations included:
- **Firewall Rules:** Blocking of non-essential ports and restriction of external traffic.
- **Antivirus & Web Filtering:** Real-time scanning of incoming and outgoing data.
- **VPN:** Secure remote access for employees working offsite.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Detection and mitigation of potential attacks.

During implementation, several penetration tests were conducted to validate the firewall rules and ensure compliance with the defined security parameters.

## Results
The implementation of the UTM system achieved the following results:
- 95% reduction in detected intrusion attempts.
- Improved control of user access to external web services.
- Enhanced visibility through centralized monitoring dashboards.
- Stable VPN connections ensuring secure remote work capabilities.

## Conclusions
The implementation of the UTM firewall significantly strengthened the organization’s cybersecurity posture. It not only improved protection against external threats but also optimized internal management of network resources. The training sessions allowed the IT team to operate the system effectively, ensuring long-term sustainability of the solution.

As a next step, it is recommended to schedule quarterly security audits and update UTM firmware regularly to maintain optimal protection levels.
